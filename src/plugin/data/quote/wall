The three chief virtues of a programmer are: Laziness, Impatience and Hubris.
The world has become a larger place. The universe has been expanding, and Perl's been expanding along with the universe.
Because . doesn't match \n. [\0-\377] is the most efficient way to match everything currently. Maybe \e should match everything. And \E would of course match nothing.
Real programmers can write assembly code in any language.
What about WRITING it first and rationalizing it afterwards?
I think it's a new feature. Don't tell anyone it was an accident.
Just don't create a file called -rf.  :-)
Doing linear scans over an associative array is like trying to club someone to death with a loaded Uzi.
Anyway, there's plenty of room for doubt. It might seem easy enough, but computer language design is just like a stroll in the park. Jurassic Park, that is.
They can always run stderr through uniq.  :-)
The computer should be doing the hard work. That's what it's paid to do, after all.
A 'goto' in Perl falls into the category of hard things that should be possible, not easy things that should be easy.
Reserve your abuse for your true friends.
It's easy to solve the halting problem with a shotgun.  :-)
I'm reminded of the day my daughter came in, looked over my shoulder at some Perl 4 code, and said, 'What is that, swearing?'
So I'm thinking about ??, or !!, or //, or \\, or whatever. But I think I like ?? the best so far. Or the least worst.
My arthritic pinkies are already starting to ache just thinking about ||||=.
