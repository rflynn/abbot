Don't get lost in thought; you'll be a total stranger there.
You're good looking in a way ...away off.
Don't you ever get tired of having you around?
Someday you'll find yourself, and will you be disappointed.
I know you have to be somebody, but why do you have to be you?
If you said what you thought, you'd be speechless.
You think you're a wit, and you're probably half right.
Why don't you go blow your brains out, you've got nothing to lose.
If there's ever a price on your head, take it.
You were born at home, but when your mother saw you she went to the hospital.
Someday you'll go far, and I hope you stay there.
I wish I had a lower I.Q., so that I could enjoy your company.
I'm not going to get into a battle of wits with you; I never attack anyone who's unarmed.
Is your family happy, or do you go home at night?
You have an open mind, and a mouth to match.
I wish your parents had never met.
There's only one thing that keeps me from breaking you in half, I don't want two of you around.
If you ever need a friend, you'll have to get a dog.
You're outspoken, but not by anyone I know.
There's enough people in this world who hate you, without you working so hard to get another one.
I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in public.
I don't know what makes you so screwed up, but whatever it is, it works.
You do serve at least one useful purpose in life, as a horrible example.
Are you always this stupid, or are you making a special effort today?
It's too bad stupidity isn't painful.
Thinking isn't your strong point, is it?
If I've said anything to offend you, I mean it.
I would love to insult you, but you wouldn't understand.
Why do you get up in the morning?
You're a person of rare intelligence; it's rare when you show any.
I'd explain it to you, but I don't have any crayons with me.
Do you want me to accept you as you are, or do you want me to like you?
Are you a moron, or are you possessed by a retarded ghost?
So tell me, as an outsider, what do you think of the human race?
I notice that you never let an idea interrupt the flow of your conversation.
Don't try so hard, I couldn't like you any less.
You're having delusions of competence.
