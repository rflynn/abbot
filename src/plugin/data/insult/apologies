I apologize.
whoops, sorry, i thought you were someone else.
sorry about all that, no hard feelings right?
sorry; they say you hurt the ones you love.
you know i didn't mean any of it.
sorry, i've had a rough day. 
sorry, i don't know what came over me.
I feel terrible about what happened. I've just been under a lot of stress lately down at the plant, y'know. They're bringing in computers to "improve productivity" and, well, that's no excuse for how I acted. If you'll accept my apology, well, I hope we can put this embarrassing incident behind us.
