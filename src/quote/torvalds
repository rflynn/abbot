Only wimps use tape backup: _real_ men just upload their important stuff on ftp, and let the rest of the world mirror it ;)
Portability is for people who cannot write new programs.
Talk is cheap. Show me the code.
I'm a bastard. I have absolutely no clue why people can ever think otherwise.
Most days I wake up thinking I'm the luckiest bastard alive.
Personally, I'm _not_ interested in making device drivers look like user-level. They aren't, they shouldn't be, and microkernels are just stupid.
Those that can, do. Those that can't, complain.
Really, I'm not out to destroy Microsoft. That will just be a completely unintentional side effect.
Modern PCs are horrible. ACPI is a complete design disaster in every way. But we're kind of stuck with it. If any Intel people are listening to this and you had anything to do with ACPI, shoot yourself now, before you reproduce.
A lot of people still like Solaris, but I'm in active competition with them, and so I hope they die.
Making Linux GPL'd was definitely the best thing I ever did.
Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.
Is "I hope you all die a painful death" too strong?
Nobody should start to undertake a large project. You start with a small _trivial_ project, and you should never expect it to get large. If you do, you'll just overdesign and generally think it is more important than it likely is at that stage.
Theory and practice sometimes clash. And when that happens, theory loses. Every single time.
Software is like sex; it's better when it's free.
95 percent of all software developers believe they are in the top 5 percent, when it comes to knowledge and skills.
Microsoft isn't evil, they just make really crappy operating systems.
Intelligence is the ability to avoid doing work, yet getting the work done.
