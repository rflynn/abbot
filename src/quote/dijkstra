If debugging is the process of removing bugs, programming must be the process of putting them in.
The question of whether computers can think is like the question of whether submarines can swim.
The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal offense.
Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.
It is practically impossible to teach good programming style to students that have had prior exposure to BASIC.  As potential programmers, they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.
Testing shows the presence, not the absence, of bugs.
The competent programmer is fully aware of the limited size of his own skull. He therefore approaches his task with full humility, and avoids clever tricks like the plague.
Elegance is not a dispensable luxury but a quality that decides between success and failure.
Write a paper promising salvation, make it a 'structured' something or a 'virtual' something, or 'abstract', 'distributed' or 'higher-order' or 'applicative' and you can almost be certain of having started a new cult.
If you want more effective programmers, you will discover that they should not waste their time debugging, they should not introduce the bugs to start with.
Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability.
