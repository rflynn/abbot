If the automobile had followed the same development cycle as the computer, a Rolls-Royce would today cost $100, get a million miles per gallon, and explode once a year, killing everyone inside. -- Robert X. Cringely
Computers are getting smarter all the time.  Scientists tell us that soon they will be able to talk to us.  (And by "they", I mean "computers".  I doubt scientists will ever be able to talk to us.) -- Dave Barry
I've noticed lately that the paranoid fear of computers becoming intelligent and taking over the world has almost entirely disappeared from the common culture.  Near as I can tell, this coincides with the release of MS-DOS. -- Larry DeLuca
The question of whether computers can think is like the question of whether submarines can swim. -- Edsger W. Dijkstra
It's ridiculous to live 100 years and only be able to remember 30 million bytes.  You know, less than a compact disc.  The human condition is really becoming more obsolete every minute. -- Marvin Minsky

The Internet?  Is that thing still around? -- Homer Simpson
The Web is like a dominatrix.  Everywhere I turn, I see little buttons ordering me to Submit. -- Nytwind
Come to think of it, there are already a million monkeys on a million typewriters, and Usenet is nothing like Shakespeare. -- Blair Houghton

True innovation often comes from the small startup who is lean enough to launch a market but lacks the heft to own it. -- Timm Martin
It has been said that the great scientific disciplines are examples of giants standing on the shoulders of other giants.  It has also been said that the software industry is an example of midgets standing on the toes of other midgets. -- Alan Cooper
It is not about bits, bytes and protocols, but profits, losses and margins. -- Lou Gerstner
We are Microsoft.  Resistance Is Futile.  You Will Be Assimilated. -- Bumper sticker

They are, in short, a perfect match. -- Bill Bryson
Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter. -- Eric Raymond
A programmer is a person who passes as an exacting expert on the basis of being able to turn out, after innumerable punching, an infinite series of incomprehensive answers calculated with micrometric precisions from vague assumptions based on debatable figures taken from inconclusive documents and carried out on instruments of problematical accuracy by persons of dubious reliability and questionable mentality for the avowed purpose of annoying and confounding a hopelessly defenseless department that was unfortunate enough to ask for the information in the first place. -- IEEE Grid newsmagazine
A hacker on a roll may be able to produce, in a period of a few months, something that a small development group (say, 7-8 people) would have a hard time getting together over a year.  IBM used to report that certain programmers might be as much as 100 times as productive as other workers, or more. -- Peter Seebach
The best programmers are not marginally better than merely good ones.  They are an order-of-magnitude better, measured by whatever standard: conceptual creativity, speed, ingenuity of design, or problem-solving ability. -- Randall E. Stross

There are only two kinds of programming languages: those people always bitch about and those nobody uses. -- Bjarne Stroustrup
PHP is a minor evil perpetrated and created by incompetent amateurs, whereas Perl is a great and insidious evil perpetrated by skilled but perverted professionals. -- Jon Ribbens
The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should therefore be regarded as a criminal offense. -- E.W. Dijkstra

Saying that Java is nice because it works on all OSes is like saying that anal sex is nice because it works on all genders. -- Alanna
Fine, Java MIGHT be a good example of what a programming language should be like.  But Java applications are good examples of what applications SHOULDN'T be like. -- pixadel
If Java had true garbage collection, most programs would delete themselves upon execution. -- Robert Sewell

Good programmers use their brains, but good guidelines save us having to think out every case. -- Francis Glassborow
In software, we rarely have meaningful requirements.  Even if we do, the only measure of success that matters is whether our solution solves the customerâ€™s shifting idea of what their problem is. -- Jeff Atwood
Considering the current sad state of our computer programs, software development is clearly still a black art, and cannot yet be called an engineering discipline. -- Bill Clinton
You can't have great software without a great team, and most software teams behave like dysfunctional families. -- Jim McCarthy
As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought.  Debugging had to be discovered.  I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs. -- Maurice Wilkes discovers debugging, 1949
Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.  Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it. -- Brian Kernighan
If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. -- Edsger W. Dijkstra
